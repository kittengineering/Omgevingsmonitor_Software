# Gadget Firmware
## üõ†Ô∏è Project status
**Still in development.**

Check ‚úÖ[Roadmap](#roadmap) for progress.

## üìá Name
Beurs Gadget WoTS / MJSGadget environment monitor

## ‚ùì Description
This project is using the MJS PCB in combination with the added environment measurement PCB. 

The final product will include these functions:

**Environment monitoring**
- Microphone measurements.
- Humidity temperature measurements.
- VOC measurements.
- PM, NOx, VOC, RH & T measurements (Optional sensor upgrade).

**Communication**
- WiFi communication
- Sending the sensor and gps data to the sensor community server.
- Webpage to set parameters.
- Low power capabilities.

**Other**
- LED indication for Status, dB and VOC.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Make sure you have the following installed:
- GDB server
- STM32CubeIDE
- STM32CuberMonitor-Power -> For debugging purposes.

- Generate code via .ioc file.
- Go to run -> Debug Configurations -> MJSGadget Debug -> Debugger -> Scan your ST-link serial number

Make sure the library paths link to your repository files.

In STM32CubeIDE change the paths under:
- Project -> Properties -> C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols
- Repository default installation location: C:Users/YOURUSERNAME/STM32Cube/Repository.

## üìó Usage
~~Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.~~

## ü§ù Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## ‚òéÔ∏è Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
